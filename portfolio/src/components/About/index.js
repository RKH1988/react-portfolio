        <h1 id="about">About Me, RK Harris</h1>
        <p>As a recent graduate of the November 2022 UNC Coding Bootcamp Cohort, I have increased my skillset to encompass full-stack web-development. My background is in accounting and fundraising. My passion is utilizing my talents to help others, for I believe that fulfillment comes when we are selfless. </p>
        <p>I attended UNC - Greensboro for a BS and MS in Accounting. I received an MBA from ECU and a certificate in Training and Development from Northcentral University. In addition to a robust education, I have 10 years of fundraising experience - from Annual Giving to Database Management. My passion, of course, is the database. Having worked with Ellucian Banner, eTapestry, Raiser's Edge, and Salesforce (Causeview, QGiv, OneCause, NPSP), I have developed a wide array of knowledge surrounding best practices in a philanthropic database and the web tools that make a philanthropy shop successful. </p>
        <p>I desire to remain in the non-profit space with goals of eventually achieving Database Administrator status.</p>
